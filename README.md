Sentimental Analysis on 170 website links using Web Scrapping and NLP with Python



In this project I have done Sentimental Analysis on 170 links from BlackCoffer Website.


First I have extracted the required data from these websites using WebScrapping.
Then I saved all the data in text files.
Then I have applied NLP on all those TextFiles Step-By-Step (python xlrd version 1.2.0 is used)
After that I have created some vairables and wrote that data on excel sheet.


The Report is yet to be added.
